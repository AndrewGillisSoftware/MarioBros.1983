Our Mario Bros 1983 c++ creation as of now has a near complete framework/engine to build off of.
Loading and distributing assets is managed by a completed assetmanager class, working with sounds, textures, and animations. 
Base classes are made for the basic structure of the game; entity, player, collidable, level and Game. 
Tied in with them is a working animation modulefor collidables. Collidable is at the base of the heirarchy, 
and is a child of sfml's sprite. A crude method for creating level files has been created, but needs work. Both animations and level files
are read in, using json file library methods. Things that we left off refining and constructing were the collisions, developing enemies and creating their
animations, creating sounds for the game (use sfxr for good sound creation), and level creation. Those would be places to start.
